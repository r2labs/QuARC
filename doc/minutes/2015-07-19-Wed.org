* Changes to the project since last semester
- Project name change
  - QuARC to TBD (possibly ARC)
- PWM
  - TI 123GSL board used instead of Nucleo
  - allows for our home-rolled OS to control PWM signals
  - no licensing infringement
  - intimate knowledge of the interface and internals
- IFC
  - GNU/Linux instead of Android on IFC
  - less overhead
- Current protection between PWM and arm
  - NTE977 Op Amps
    - we made a trip to fry's to obtain them
* Accomplshments
- Got the arm to move
  - Coded operating system to input signals
  - Problem: Servos experience oscillation when holding a position
    - cause: seems to be insufficient current supplied to arm via board
    - solution: op amps to control current better via sepic regulator
* TODO
- open issues
- tackle open issues
- next time: make the arm grab something
  - requires solid base
  - requires connections to multiple motors
  - requires stable motor control (hook up op amps)
